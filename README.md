# Merry
Merry is an attempt at combining all forms of computation with added flexiblity to ensure people can be as creative as they wish to be and the system allows them to be. Since I have in the dark when it comes to categorizing Merry, I prefer to call it broadly hybrid complementing the broad number of computation models it can support. 

An attempt was made to write an assembler to showcase the virtual machine but I have failed, thus, I will be providing documents and write code in binary to test the VM.
