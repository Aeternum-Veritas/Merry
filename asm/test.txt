;; Variables can be declared anywhere and used anywhere
;; Its not like you have to define them first to use them.
;; If a variable exists in the included file, you can access it as well.

;; These constants are like #define from C.
;; These will not be in the final binary.
;; The assembler will replace them in the source everywhere
cstring msg: "Hello"
cbyte len: 256
;; .. and for all

;; You can certainly use other variables to initialize other variables
;; However, you cannot do arithmetic using '+', '-' and other symbols yet.
;; That will have to wait until an expression parser is in place
;; Something like: byte version: (MAJOR * 1000) << 63 ... would be cool, wouldn't it?
