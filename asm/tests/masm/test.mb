;; ;; This is the "build script" for the project

data test.mdat ;; Include the "test.mdat" data file and put its contents at first
code test.masm ;; The code
code test2.masm

;; Include the files as necessary just like above
;; For now these are the only two things that can be done with this file type
;; In future, maybe this file does more than just this

;; The order in which the files appear is the exact order in which they appear in their respective sections in the final binary
;; This file makes sure that a file is not included more than once.
;; With the probable addition of built-in variables, more things could be done.
;; Data file cannot contain code and the code file cannot contain data.
;; There is no need for includes as any file in here already shares a scope.
