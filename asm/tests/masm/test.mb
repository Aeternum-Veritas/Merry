;; ;; This is the "build script" for the project

data tests/masm/test.mdat ;; Include the "test.mdat" data file and put its contents at first
code tests/masm/test.masm ;; The code
code tests/masm/test2.masm

;; depends <another .mb file to include here>

;; Here the <THING TO DO> means one of the above command obviously
;; defined <CONSTANT/VARIABLE> <THING TO DO>
;; ndefined <CONSTANT/VARIABLE> <THING TO DO>

;; ;; Thanks to the way the input file format is created, there can be multiple entries
;; entry <ENTRY LABEL OR PROCEDURE>
;; entry <ANOTHER ENTRY LABEL OR PROCEDURE>

;; ;; eepe = EAT entry per entry(meaning how many times to copy the above two in final binary)
;; eepe <A NUMBER>

;; ;; eepe but just for ENTRY
;; teepe <ENTRY> <A NUMBER>

;; Include the files as necessary just like above
;; For now these are the only two things that can be done with this file type
;; In future, maybe this file does more than just this

;; The order in which the files appear is the exact order in which they appear in their respective sections in the final binary
;; This file makes sure that a file is not included more than once.
;; With the probable addition of built-in variables, more things could be done.
;; Data file cannot contain code and the code file cannot contain data.
;; There is no need for includes as any file in here already shares a scope.
