The memory allocators in Merry are of two types: EndMeet allocator and Temporary allocator.

Temporary allocator is like the standard library provided allocator that provides memory for temporary things in the VM.
The memory allocated by this allocator is almost freed immediately. EndMeet allocator have what can be called pools: small and big pools.
The small pool is used when small amount of data is necessary whereas big pool is used when large amount of data is required.

Temporary allocator recycles the initial memory while EndMeet can and will keep requesting for new memory if the ones in its control are consumed.
EndMeet allocator is used by the VM's internal data structures for getting memory that is guranteed to be freed before the VM exits.

Both allocators are thread safe.
