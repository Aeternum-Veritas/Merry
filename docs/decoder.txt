For the sake of speed, decoder has been introduced that will do the heavylifting while the Core just reads a decoded instruction and initiates it's execution.
The decoder runs as a separate thread that the Core it belongs to controls. It is provided with a copy of it's master core's pointer which it uses to access the memory and data.
The decoder manages an instruction queue which holds the decoded instructions that the master Core uses.
