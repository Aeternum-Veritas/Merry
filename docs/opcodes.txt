NOTE: The register indexing can be done by just 4 bits as there are only 16 registers available to the program.
NOTE: Most instructions have variants. For eg: add_imm and add_reg which can be generalized into add.

            register: The lower four bits of the second byte.
            immediate: 4 bytes immediate in the lower 4 bytes[Can be expanded into 6 bytes immediate at most]
            example: 0x02 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC 0xDD -> add 0xAABBCCDD to whatever is in the Ma[as indicated by the lower 4 bits of the second byte].

move_imm_64 -> opcode: 0x1B
               operands: one register and a 64 bits value that follows the instruction in the memory.
               example: 0x1B 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 -> Move 64 bits immediate into Ma[as represented by the lower 4 bits of the 8th byte]
                        immediately after this instruction, the 64-bit value must follow i.e say 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC 0xDD 0xEE 0xFF 0x00 0x01
                        These 8 bytes will be moved into Ma.

move_reg -> opcode: 0x1C
            operands: two registers
            details: moves the entire 8 bytes from one register to another.
            example: 0x1C 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 -> Here in the last byte 0x01, which is 0b0000_0001. So, from Mb(0001) register, source, 8 bytes are moved into Ma(0000), destination.

               example: 0x20 0x00 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x1D -> sign extend 0x1D to 8 bytes and store it in Mf register.

movesx_imm16 -> opcode: 0x21 : same as  movesx_imm8 but with 2 bytes immediate value.
movesx_imm32 -> opcode: 0x22 : same as  movesx_imm8 but with 4 bytes immediate value.

{
   UPDATE:
   Now, movesx_regX uses the lowest byte for encoding registers.
}
movesx_reg8 -> opcode: 0x23
               operands: 2 registers
               example: 0x23 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 -> Here the last byte, 0x01 which is 0b0000_0001. This implies the source is the Mb register and destination is Ma register.
               This instruction moves the lower 1 byte from the destination register while sign extending it[Clears the upper bytes of the destination register].

movesx_reg16: opcode: 0x24 : same as movesx_reg8 but moves 2 bytes instead.
movesx_reg32: opcode: 0x25 : same as movesx_reg8 but moves 4 bytes instead.

NOTE: movezx is unnecessary but the general move instruction can be aliased with movezx.

jmp_off -> opcode: 0x26
           operands: a 6 byte immediate
           details: This jmp variants requires a 6 byte immediate which is treated as a signed number i.e the 0th bit is the sign bit.
                    The immediate is sign extended as per the sign and then added to the pc.
           example: 0x26 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 -> The last 6 bytes are the offset. Since it is a signed value, providing 2's complemented negative value will decrement the PC.

jmp_addr -> opcode: 0x27
            operands: 8 bytes address that follows the instruction in memory.
            example: if the jmp_addr instruction is encountered, the next 8 bytes are read again which is the address to jump to.

       operands: The destination register and the offset
       details: The SVA(Stack Variable Access) instruction is used to access variables from the stack. The given offset is used to get the required value from the stack by subtracting it from BP.
                The value is then written to the destination register. The offset is 2 bytes long at most and it is treated as unsigned.
       example: 0x2A 0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x07 -> Subtract "0x00 0x07" from BP and put it into register 0x03[Mc].

svc -> opcode: 0x2B
       operands: The same as sva at the exact same byte position.
       details: SVC(Stack Variable Change) is used to change the value of a variable on the stack. Works in the same way as sva except the value in the register is written to that offset in stack.

push_imm -> opcode: 0x2C
            operands: a 6 bytes immediate.
            example: 0x2C 0x00 [6 bytes of immediate] -> The 6 bytes of immediate is pushed onto the stack.

push_reg -> opcode: 0x2D
            operands: The source register
            example: 0x2D 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 -> Pushes whatever is in the the register Mb onto the stack[0x01 is 0b0000_0001 and the lower 4 bits are used].

       example: 0x2E 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x05 -> Pop the top of the stack into the register 0x05 which is the Mf register.

pusha -> opcode: 0x2F
         details: Pushes all the 16 registers onto the stack.

        details: pops 16 values from the stack in the reverse order of pusha into all 16 registers

and_imm -> opcode: 0x31
           operands: the source register which is also the destination register and a 64-bit value that follows the instruction in the memory.
           example: 0x31 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01
                    0x00 0xFf 0xAA 0x10 0x11 0xEE 0x00 0x04 -> Performs AND operation on the value in register 0x01[Mb] and the following value.

                     source register.

lshift -> opcode: 0x38
          example: 0x38 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x0F -> Takes the value from register 0x01[Mb] and shifts it by 0x0F position. It is recommended that this value is never greater than 64.
                   The result is stored in the source register.

        operands: The destination register and 1 64-bit address to the data in data memory that follows the instruction in instruction memory.
        example: 0x3F 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x05

                 Note: It is to be noted that addresses shouldn't be that big(at most 20 bits) and within the bounds as well.

{
   Memory details:
   Both the data memory and the instruction memory are divided into pages of 1MB. The larger the program the more pages is allocated by the VM to fit it all.
   Same applies for the data in the program, the more data it has the more pages are allocated to fit it all. Even if the program has no data a simgle page is still allocated so that if the program wants to store anything, it can.
   The instruction memory is inaccessible to the program but the whole data memory belongs to it. Every byte is addressible in the data memory i.e address 12345 would address the 12345th byte in the first page. This allows for 1048576 addresses.
   Now, it is recommended that the addresses are 8 bytes aligned. Here is why: Say the program is requesting the byte 102. As the VM is 64-bit, 8 bytes are read at once i.e byte 102 through 109. This is completely fine but it is not 8 byte aligned.
   By 8 bytes aligned, I mean the address should be a multiple of 8 i.e 8, 16, 24, 32....
   Now say the program requests to read the byte 1048574. As the VM tries to read the corresponding 8 bytes, it finds that the read exceeds the boundary of the page and thus an error is thrown.
   For the sake of simplicity, the program can assume that the memory is linear meaning the program can think of the memory as an array of bytes rather than a group of bytes divided into different pages. So using the address 1048577 would access
   the first byte from the second page. Though the error of the page boundary access still remains.  
}

[
  A few aliases that I would like to set:
  When I am Nibble Encoding, I am referring to the encoding of two registers in 1 byte i.e say 0x01 which would be 0b0000_0001 is encoding 2 registers; 0000 and 0001 namely Ma and Mb.
  So if I say 8th byte Nibble Encoding then I am saying that the 8th byte of the instruction encodes two registers as mentioned above.
