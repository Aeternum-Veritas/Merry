Conventions:
The variables for the library will begin as _Mstd
The procedures for the library will begin as __builtin
Any constants will be named as __MSTD
Any procedures that hide or abstract the __builtin* procedures will use the same name but without the __builtin

The procedures take arguments as follow:
1st arg -> Ma
2nd arg -> Mb
3rd arg -> Mc
4th arg -> Md
5th arg -> Me

The return value of the procedures is in Ma and it maybe -1 or 0.

Any labels inside procedures will be named as _std*

NOTES:
Any reserved memory will be reused in the future. These reserves are being made to make everything 8-byte aligned.
