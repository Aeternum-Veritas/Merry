Conventions:
The variables for the library will begin as _Mstd
The procedures for the library will begin as __builtin
Any constants will be named as __MSTD
Any procedures that hide or abstract the __builtin* procedures will use the same name but without the __builtin

The procedures take arguments as follow:
1st arg -> M1
2nd arg -> M2
3rd arg -> M3
4th arg -> Mm1
5th arg -> Mm2

Any reserved memory will be reused in the future. These reserves are being made to make everything 8-byte aligned.
