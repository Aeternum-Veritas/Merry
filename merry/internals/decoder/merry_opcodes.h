/*
 The structure of an instruction:
 We need opcodes and operands. For operands that are 64 bit long, they should be right after the instruction in memory.
 Opcodes are 9 bits long, for now atleast.
 This provides us with 512 possible instructions. If we need to expand then we can do so in the future.
 For now, 9 bits is enough.
 This leaves us with 55 bits that can be used for the operands.
 Since we have a lot of possible opcodes, we will not make use of any flags and instead use different variants for the same instruction
